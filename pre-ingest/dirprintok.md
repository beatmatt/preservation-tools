| **Description**  | File manager with export function of the directory structure with various metadata or file information in XLS, CSV, TXT or HTML. |
| **Operation System**  | Windows  |
| **Application**  | Metadata extraction, Checksum creation  |
| **File Format** | - |
| **Experience** | Quite good and intuitive tool, but the file names are supplemented with special characters to visualize a hierarchy. If you want to use such a CSV automatically, you would first have to filter out all | and + in column A with Search and Replace. Extremely fast. For the export, all subfolders to be read must first be opened (one click). Extensive metadata, but sometimes only the same in a different form (e.g. file size). |
