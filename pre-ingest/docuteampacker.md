| **Description** | Docuteam packer is a client application for creating and editing digital deliveries to an archive. In the archive, Packer is used to control and edit information packages. Packer is a Java application that runs on Windows, OS X and Linux. |
| **Operation System** | Windows, Mac, Linux |
| **File Format** | - |
| **Experience** | Very intuitive tool that includes all important functions for image creation, metadata enrichment and encapsulation. The SIP (ZIP capsule) contains the original data as well as a METS XML with the metadata (incl. SHA512 checksum, PRONOM ID) and documentation of the SIP creation. Reading the original data and saving them as SIP may take some time for larger files (approx. 10min each for 3.5 GB), but a file boundary of 2GB is also known (which should be fixed). |
