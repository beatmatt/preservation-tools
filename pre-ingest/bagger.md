# Bagger

| Category | Evaluation |

| **Description**  | ... |
| **Operation System**  | Windows, Mac, Unix  |
| **Application**  | File Transfer  |
| **File Format** | BagIt |
| **Experience** | No longer supported or further developed. Statement from one of the earlier main developers at the Library of Congress: He was the only one to actively maintain it at the Library for the past few years. Intern conversations showed, that there was no plan to do anything with Bagger as a java desktop application is no longer considered best practice. If one is ok with a command line tool, bagit.py was being supported by a co-worker who still works there (Chris Adams). |
