| --- | --- |
| **Description**  | TreeSize Professional is a powerful hard disk space manager for all Windows versions currently supported by Microsoft and Windows client and server versions (32 and 64 bit). The tool supports disk management, provides a quick (graphical) overview of disk usage (file types, file sizes, number of files, hierarchy) and allows detailed analyses down to lower directory levels. Duplicate searches with deduplication are also possible. With the snapshot function, analysis results can be saved and compared with an earlier or later point in time (change in memory allocation). In contrast to TreeSize Personal, the Professional version also allows the analysis of network drives. |
| **Operation System**  | Windows  |
| **Application**  | Metadata extraction, checksum creation, deduplication |
| **File Format** | - |
| **Experience** | The tool is very intuitive and fast. A great strength is the fast analysis of disk space usage, existing file formats and key topics. The historical analysis is also helpful (How old are the individual files?). The export of the results is easy and individually configurable, also file properties can be exported to Excel, CSV, text, PDF, XML and HTML. Important settings in the export options: "Export complete directory tree" and "Add individual files to export". For data analysis, a copy of the digital resources should always be used to avoid changes to the original data. Interventions are also not logged and must therefore be documented manually.
