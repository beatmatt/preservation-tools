| Category | Evaluation |
| --- | --- |
| **Description**  | BulkFileChanger is a small utility that allows you to create files list from multiple folders, and then make some action on them - Modify their created/modified/accessed time, change their file attribute (Read Only, Hidden, System), run an executable with these files as parameter, and copy/cut paste into Explorer. |
| **Operation System**  | Windows  |
| **Application**  | Metadata editing |
| **File Format** | - |
| **Experience** | Functions great! Easy handling. Be aware: If you set a date prior to 01/01/1980, Windows Explorer will not display this date, due to a limitation originally created for old FAT systems. You can still watch an old file date using other file managers like 7-zip, using BulkFileChanger utility, or by right-clicking on the file and choosing 'Properties'. |
