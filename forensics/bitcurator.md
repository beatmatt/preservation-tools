| **Operation System**  | Linux |
| **Application**  | Imaging, Analyzing, Transfer |
| **File Format** | - |
| **Experience** | Very stable and easy to use toolbox. Depending on the mode of operation (in VM or with stand-alone installation) there may be problems with the stable connection of read devices (concerns: VM). The individual tools are very mature and professional, but for simpler application purposes sometimes too professional. |
