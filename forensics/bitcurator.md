| **Description** | Live CD or virtual machine (e.g. for VirtualBox) based on Ubuntu with an extensive toolbox for creating and mounting images (incl. Mac formats based on HFS, target formats among others E01), generating and checking checksums as well as analyzing and exporting data carrier content and file metadata. In addition, duplicate identification tools, a BagIt packer and an antivirus scanner are integrated. Finally, there are data forensic tools for data carrier analysis and definitive data deletion. |
| **Operation System** | Windows, Mac, Linux |
| **File Format** | - |
| **Experience** | Very stable and easy to use toolbox. Depending on the mode of operation (in VM or with stand-alone installation) there may be problems with the stable connection of read devices (concerns: VM). The individual tools are very mature and professional, but for simpler application purposes sometimes too professional. A Software Write Blocker is implemented which is suitable for pure image creation without analysis of the carrier. However, a hardware write blocker is recommended for security reasons, at least for certain data carriers. The technical requirements require an Intel Core i7 (6th gen or better) or AMD Ryzen 1700 (or better) processor, minimum 16GB RAM and an SSD for the main OS. Experience has shown that with 16GB RAM a much better and faster handling is possible. The Toolbox is optimally equipped, tools can be added if required. The executability in a VM is good, but depending on the periphery sometimes tedious and time-consuming (especially USB). Tests are running in a stand-alone version. |
