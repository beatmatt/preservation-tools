| **Description** | DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke) is a tool for the complete cleaning of hard disks (not only delete, but overwrite with random data). Boot image for data volume and emergency destruction. |
| **Operation System** | Windows, Mac, Linux |
| **File Format** | - |
| **Experience** | Free version can provide the main features, but only as ISO and not in terms of SSDs. For business use and with a certificate for guaranteed traceless erasure, one would have to switch to Blancco Drive Eraser. It is not quite clear according to the website what this would cost. However, DBAN is recommended in relevant literature on research data management. |
| **Licence** | Free version (open source and only for "private use") or version for business use (costs unknown) |
