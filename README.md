# Preservation Tools

For the individual steps of digital long-term archiving in the University Library of Basel, I have tried out and collected various tools over the past few years and now published the results here. The collection is under ongoing review, partly the existence of a tool is proven, but the concrete suitability has not yet been tested. I have also included information and experiences from libraries such as COPTR (https://coptr.digipres.org/Category:Tools), where useful.

Suggestions for further tools are always welcome, therefore please feel free to open an issue.
