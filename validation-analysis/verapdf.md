| **Description** | Validator for different types of PDF file formats (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 2u, 3a, 3b, 3u), developed by the Open Preservation Foundation. |
| **Operation System** | Windows, Mac, Linux |
| **File Format** | PDF |
| **Experience** | Very easy and intuitive tool. Different profiles for validation can be defined (also custom profiles) and policies can be added. The tool can also be integrated into process chains. Information from KLA Workshop 2018: Question whether the validation tool JHOVE is still the only validator for standard PDF. The answer is "Yes", because veraPDF is not suitable for the validation of standard PDF. |
