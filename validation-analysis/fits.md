| **Description** | File Information Tool Set (FITS) was developed by Harvard University and identifies, validates and extracts technical metadata from a variety of file formats. FITS combines and uses several other tools ([ADL Tool](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/fits/tools#adl_tool), [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/), [DROID](./droid.md), [Exiftool](./exiftool.md), FFIdent (no longer maintained - the archived website can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20061106114156/http://schmidt.devlib.org/ffident/index.html)), [Fine Free File Command](https://github.com/file) ([windows port](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/)), [JHOVE](./jhove.md), [MediaInfo](./mediainfo.md), [National Library of New Zealand Metadata Extractor](http://meta-extractor.sourceforge.net/), [OIS Audio Information](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/fits/tools#ois_audio), [OIS File Information](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/fits/tools#ois_file), [OIS XML Information](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/fits/tools#ois_xml)). The outputs from these many tools are converted into a common format, compared and consolidated into a common XML output file. |
